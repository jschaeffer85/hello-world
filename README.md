# hello-world
This repository is to help me learn how GitHub works.

Hello,
I am an instructional designer that likes learning about coding. In my spare time I play video games and am learning how to use Unity to build my own games. Also, I like tacos.

I added a project today and am trying to understand how and what it does.
